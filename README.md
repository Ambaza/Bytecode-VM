# Bytecode-VM
Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the source code, and the VM interprets and executes this bytecode. Let's create a simple bytecode and a stack-based virtual machine in Python
The SimpleVM class interprets a simple bytecode, which performs addition and multiplication operations. The OpCode class defines the available opcodes, and the SimpleVM class interprets these opcodes, manipulating a stack to perform arithmetic operations.

This example is a minimalistic introduction to bytecode and VM. A more comprehensive implementation would include support for variables, control flow, and a more extensive set of operations.
